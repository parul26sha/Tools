ER Diagrams – pictorial representation of relations between tables in RDBMS.

Types of Relations:
One-One:one customer having one mobile number ,or every employee belongs to one department

One-Many:one customer may be having more than one order.
Many-Many: an order can have multiple products and a product can be in multiple orders 
primaryKey – A column or Set of Columns which help to identify a row uniquely.PK cannot be null or empty
In a table. Max of 32 columns we can combine I oracle DB as PK.
ForeignKey – A column that enforces referential integrity. A column in one table(child table)

Kind of Mobile Apps:
Native Apps – developed in specific OS supported language(c, java) and needs that particular domain expertise
Fast, Reliable, best user experience and easy access to wider functionalities of device like camera, gps, contactList , accelerometer
Publishers can use Push notifications to alert for new things.

Installed through PlayStore or AppStore

You can work even when you are offline.
Eg: Facebook, linked in, Angrybirds, whatsApp etc….

HyperLogLog is an algorithm for the count-distinct problem, approximating the number of distinct elements in a multiset.[1]
Calculating the exact cardinality of a multiset requires an amount of memory proportional to the cardinality, which is impractical 
for very large data sets.
Probabilistic cardinality estimators, such as the HyperLogLog algorithm, use significantly less 
memory than this, at the cost of obtaining only an approximation of the cardinality. The HyperLogLog algorithm is able to estimate
cardinalities of > 109 with a typical accuracy of 2%, using 1.5 kB of memory.
[1] HyperLogLog is an extension of the earlier LogLog algorithm,[2] itself deriving from the 1984 Flajolet–Martin algorithm.[
