Software - Program or collection of programs/Set of instructions that we give to computer.
allows user to interact with computer, computer hardware or performs some tasks.

Ex: Internet browser, Operating System, MS Word

SDLC - Software Development Life Cycle.
It is a framework.It defines what all tasks you should perform to develop and maintain the software.

Benefit:
quality of software
customer requirements/customer expectation/customer satisfaction
Time and cost

SDLC stages
Planning and Requirement Analysis
Defining Requirement
Design
Implementation
Test
Deployment
Maintenance

Planning and Requirement Analysis
Preliminary analysis
project Manager - customer, sales department, and other experts
how to do a project, product feasibility, customer requirements
Cost and technical aspects
Risk associated

Ex: 	User registration
	Login
	Logout
	Dashboard Landing Page

Role - Product Owner,Project Manager, Customer

Tools/Equipments - rough document


Defining Requirements
SRS and BRD documents
SRS - Software Requirements Specification.
Functional requirements
describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform.
establishes the basis for an agreement between customers and company on what the software product is to do as well as what it is not expected to do. 
The requirement is defined clearly so that you can reduce later redesign. 
It should also provide estimating on product costs, risks.
help prevent software project failure.

BRD stands for Business Requirement Document.
what is required, rather than on how to achieve it.Non-functional requirements such as 
(1) Productivity - How much a system aids users? For example, "We used to be able to handle 10 complaints in an hour and now we can handle 12."
(2) Performance - How fast should the system be?
(3) Capacity - How much traffic must the system be able to handle?
(4) Scalability - How easily can the system be expanded to handle increased throughput?
(5) Availability - Does the system need to be 24/7, weekdays only etc...?
(6) Recoverability - How quickly should the system be made operational after an outage?
(7) Integrity - How predictable and reliable should the system be?
(8) Exception handling - How will processing exceptions be handled?
(9) Logging - Do we need to have audit trails of activities?
(10) Security - What are the security characteristics?
(11) Manageability - How easy is it to manage the system?
(12) Useability - What interfacing is required for end-users?
(13) Interoperability - Does the system need to be able to interface with other systems? How?
(14) Extensibility - Can the system be expanded to support new functionality?
(15) Maintainability - How readily can the system be understood? How extensive is the documentation.
(16) Upgradeability - How easy is it to upgrade the system?
(17) Portability - Can the system be moved to other platforms easily?
(18) Deployability - How can the system be deployed? In components or all at once?
(19) Data Currency - How up-to-date should the information be? Real-time?
(20) Data Retention - How long does data need to be kept for?
(21) Internationalization - Does the system need to support multiple time zones, languages and standards?

Role - Business Analyst, Product Manager/Owner

Tools/Equipments - SRS and BRD documents

Ex: 	User Registration
		Username input field
		Password input field
		Checkbox to accept terms and conditions
		Submit button
		Save user in database

	Login Page
		Username input field
		Password input field
		Submit button
		Read user from database
		Log user into the system
	Logout Page
		Logout button
		Clear session
		Prevent account theft
	Dashboard
		Main home page
		New users should be redirected here
		Existing users should redirect here after login


Design
blueprint for the software
Propose more than one design
DDS - Design Document Specification, reviewed by stakeholders.
Check for risks, budget and time to develop the product and select best design.
minute details will be documented in DDS
flowcharts and UML diagrams
what technologies to be used, flow of application

Role - Architect/ UI Designer

Tools/Equipments - different diagrams
		Use Case Diagrams - actors and their responsibilities
Sequence Diagrams - step by step process flow
Class Diagrams - defining variable methods or properties/actions for given behaviour
Activity Diagram - flow chart
Wireframes - Positioning UI elements

Ex: Includes Business rules, user interface layouts, color schemes, what programming languages to use, frameworks, Database relationships, Architecture of the application, supported browsers etc.

Implementation
DDS -> design to code
Choose programming language
Modules and then integrated

Role - Frontend developer nowadays called web developer, backend developer, App developer, full stack developer, DBA

Ex: operations team will set up physical hardwares for the servers, Developers write the code, Designers continue planning the user interface, tester will analyze requirements and starting building test cases with test plans.

Testing
defects or issues or faults or failures, track, get it fixed and retest it -> SRS

Role - Quality Engineer/Analyst,QA,QE

Ex: suppose development is done and a tester finds that when a user logout session is not cleared, which is nothing but someone can click on login button or refresh the page and access the records.All these are tested in testing phase.

Deployment
different servers.
	SIT - System Integration Testing
	UAT - User Acceptance Testing
	Production Testing

GIt repository or code repository
build that application and deploy it in a machine and host it from there.

Ex: 	dev.talentscreen.io
	Qa1.talentscreen.io - SIT
	Qa2.talentscreen.io - UAT
	Talentscreen.io - Live


Role - Build Engineer, Deployment Engineer, Release Engineer

Maintenance
issues/errors
enhance the product - better versions

Role - production support team, operations team, project manager, customer support.

Evaluation
Disposal

SDLC -> ALM
ALM - Application LifeCycle Management.
Same as SDLC phases.
continuous integration, continuous delivery, test driven development.


Agile Methodology

Product Owner - represent end user.

Sprint - duration, ideally 1-4 weeks

Scrum Master - Project Manager

Scrum Team - 7 +/- 2, 4 dev, 2 testers, 1 lead

Product Backlog - Whole set of requirements finalized by Product Owner

Sprint Backlog - sprint requirements chosen from product backlog based on priority for each sprint

User Stories - Set of requirements subdivided among team members/Subset of sprint backlog

Daily Standup Meeting - 15 - 20 mins
			What you have done so far
			Any issues that is blocking you from completing the work
			What you will do today

Sprint Planning Meeting - Happens before sprint starts
     Finalize what requirements this sprint should have from sprint backlog, estimation, story points

Sprint Review Meeting - Happens at the end of sprint to demo the application developed to entire team/Product review

Sprint Retrospective Meeting - Process review than product review.
				Did anything go wrong, should we change any process.
				Make sure not repeat in next sprint so you can save time and resources for next sprint

Release - move application code to production server/go live
	For every sprint, every week, for every 2 sprints.

Burndown chart - how much work needs to be done vs remaining timE

Product Backlog Meeting - All the backlog(remaining) details will be discussed.

Registration page
1) Enter all the user details - test data 
2) Click on submit button
3) Confirmation mail
4) IF already exist throw an error message

Expected Output - according to my requirements
Actual output - output we get when we execute

assert("excpected","actual")



id
tc name
tc desc
tc - steps
executing
assert
true - passed
false - defect


Severity - Inrepect to Functionality
Priority - In respect to bussiness point of view

Amazon.com

High Priority n High Severity - Ex=commerce site at checkout there is a problem

High Priority n Less Severity - Logo Pic not display properly

Less Priority n High Severity - Link very rarly clicked is not working properly
