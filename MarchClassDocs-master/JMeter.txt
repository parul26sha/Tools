Jmeter - is open source tool

is is java based tool
it is tool to do performance/load test

Performance testing - checks the performance of your system.
Responsiveness, speed, scalability, stability

LoadRunner , Silk performer

Types of performance testing:

Load testing - Testing the webapp for very high load
Stress Testing - To know the break point of the system
Volume testing - testing the db
Endurance testing - Testing the system for high load for over a peroid of time(12hr, 24hr)

Download Java and Apache Jmeter.

User point of view - How fast my application is open
Bussiness point of view - How many users i am going to serve
How fast iam gng to serve
System - Hardware Configuration
Os, CPU, Memory, N/w bandwidth, DB

In my Jmeter how to load test--
plan the test
Take a application 
create some load
create some some scenarios
implement them 
add assertions
add reports

Test Plan

Thread Group
Thread - No of Users
Rampup time - All my resquest has start 
10Seconds - 5 users

0th sec - 1st users
3rd sec - 2nd users
5th sec - 3rd user
7th sec - 4th user
9th sec - 5th user


Samplers - we add our request
Logic Controller - For Controlling the logic
Config Elements - Including ur DB/ config settings
Timers - To add delays in the threads
Pre Processor - It will be exceuted only once before for the test
post processor -  It will be exceuted only once after for the test
Assertions - Add check points on the response
Listeners - It gives the output in the form of graphs, tables


Things to observe in the output:

Load Time - Time to load the page	
Connect time -	Time taken to connect to the server
Latency - time taken to receive the first byte of the response
Size - 

Sample Error% percentage - Error percantage(No of requests, errors)
Throughput - response that are handled by webapp in 1 sec


Config Elements:

User Defined Variables: Instead of hard coding the data in the request, we can pass values 
using user defined variables

Csv data set variables : we can do data driven testing. 

Http Request Defaults: we can include any common informartion(Server/Ip name, Parameters)

Http Header Defaults : All the header information of the request is included.

JDBC connection config : for any oracle server based transastions are done using this.

Http cookie manager : dealing with cookies

Http Authorization manager : Used mainly for authenticate to any request.


Samplers: 
Http sampler, Java sampler, junit sampler, soap, ftp, smpt

Logic Controllers : 

PreProcessor : If any logic to be executed before any request.(db connections, html link parser)
PostProcessor : If any logic to be executed after any request.

JDBC Configuration : 
Download ojdbc jar and include that jar in jmeter, lib folder
JDBC Connection Configuration : URL, Class, Uname, Pwd
JDBC Request : Writing our queries
Results in Listeners : View result in table

WebServies Testing : 

Soap/Xml :
